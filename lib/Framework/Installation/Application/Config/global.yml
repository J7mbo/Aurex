# Some objects can't be shared with Auryn Injector until the Silex application has booted (as they won't exist yet) due
# to how Silex handles things internally; for example: $app['request'] and $app['security.token_storage']
boot_delay_injections:
  - request_stack
  - security.token_storage
  - security.authorization_checker

# Modules to load that alter the default silex application object. Default provided modules do not need a namespace,
# custom module will need a fully qualified namespace so the application knows where to find them - note: these are
# loaded in the order they are placed, so if one requires another to be loaded first place them in the correct order
modules:
  - AurynModule
  - MonologModule
  - DoctrineORMModule
  - FormDoctrineModule
  - RoutingModule
  - TwigModule
  - FirewallModule
