### BEFORE YOU CONTRIBUTE

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the Aurex project shall be under the terms and
conditions of the MIT License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with the
Aurex project (or its licensor James Mallison) regarding such contributions.

#### BEFORE YOU PR

Aurex strives to retain minimum compatibility with PHP 5.5.9. All source code
contributions must execute successfully in this environment.

If you're submitting non-trivial changes to the source code of the project
please add your name to this file as a CONTRIBUTOR. Changes to support
files or minor changes (e.g. whitespace fixes) -- though appreciated --
do not merit addition as a contributor. Thank you in advance!
